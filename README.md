# hex-primality

Part of [`hex`](https://github.com/kim-em/hex-dev), a computer algebra
library for Lean 4. The aim is fast executable code, fully verified, built
with spec-driven development.

Kernel-checkable primality certificates, bounded primality search, a proved
prime table, prime segments, and a `primality` tactic for Lean 4, without
Mathlib. It builds on [`hex-arith`](https://github.com/leanprover/hex-arith)
and [`hex-basic`](https://github.com/leanprover/hex-basic). Correspondence with
Mathlib's `Nat.Prime` lives in
[`hex-primality-mathlib`](https://github.com/leanprover/hex-primality-mathlib).

# Quickstart

```toml
[[require]]
name = "hex-primality"
git = "https://github.com/leanprover/hex-primality.git"
rev = "main"
```

```lean
import HexPrimality

#eval Hex.Nat.isPrime 10000019
#eval Hex.Nat.primesIn 0 30

example : Hex.Nat.Prime 2147483647 := by primality

-- Explicitly construct a certificate and offer its reusable literal.
example : Hex.Nat.Prime (2 ^ 255 - 19) := by primality?
```

# Reusable proofs

`primality?` uses a larger, finite construction profile and offers a clickable
`Try this:` replacement containing the checked certificate. Applying it removes
search from subsequent builds; Lean still replays the checker in its kernel.
The ordinary `primality` tactic retains its interactive budget. Importing
`HexIntFactor` selects a stronger construction
provider combining Pollard p-minus-one, rho and ECM; `HexPrimality` alone
retains its core-only search.
`primality? (pMinusOneStage2 := true)` enables bounded Pollard p−1
continuations within the same total attempt budget. This option defaults to
`false`.

Use `primality? using expression` to check and render a certificate supplied by
another producer. The expression may use named intermediate certificates or
custom Lean macros; the suggestion contains only ordinary constructor data.

```lean
example : Hex.Nat.Prime 17 := by
  primality? using (let two : Hex.Nat.PrimeCert := .small 2;
    .pock 17 [(3, 3, two)])
```

Supplied producers are untrusted, explicitly selected computation. They must
return closed certificate data; the kernel still checks the resulting literal.

# Functionality

- `PrimeCert` represents stored-table leaves and the square-root and cube-root
  Pocklington criteria. `checkPrime` replays a certificate by kernel reduction.
- `prime_of_pocklington` combines checked parent arithmetic with separately
  proved child primes, allowing generated libraries to share child proofs.
- `primeCert?` performs explicitly seeded, fuel-bounded certificate search;
  `isPrime?` is the bounded exact decision and `isPrime` adds a total
  trial-division fallback.
- `millerRabin` and `isProbablePrime` provide runtime compositeness filters.
  A failed test has a sound refutation theorem; a passing test is not proof of
  primality.
- `rhoFactor?` and `pMinusOneStage1` expose the bounded factor primitives used
  during certificate search. Every returned factor is validated by a theorem.
- `Squfof.factor n limits` is an explicit deterministic proper-factor search
  for `n < 2^64`. Its defaults allow 16 fixed multipliers, 65536 combined
  forward/reverse recurrence steps per multiplier, and 128 live queue entries.
  The `Result` distinguishes `factor d`, `noFactor`, `exhausted`, and
  `unsupported`, with exact attempts, steps, and peak queue usage. A returned
  divisor satisfies `Squfof.factor_spec`; the three accounting bounds also
  have public theorems. This route is not enabled in default certificate
  search. See the [native evidence](https://github.com/kim-em/hex-dev/blob/main/reports/hex-primality-squfof.md).
- `Squfof.Policy` explicitly selects `.first limits` or `.rescue limits`
  in the factor-search budgets; all defaults remain `.off`. The producer
  and nested certificate allocations are separate.
- `PMinusOne.start` saves the stage-1 residue; `PMinusOne.stage2` continues it
  over an exact prime interval. `PMinusOne.search` runs both stages, while
  the counted forms retain attempts, unchanged random state, and batch diagnostics.
  For example, `PMinusOne.search 1081 2 5 13` returns `factor 23`.
  The stage-2 bound is capped at `4194304`; `whole` is a failed split.
- `primesBelow` enumerates an exact ascending initial segment using the verified
  runtime sieve, independently of the committed table bound.
- `isTablePrime` queries the proved table of primes below `100000`, while
  `primesIn` enumerates any finite interval by exact trial division.
- `nextPrime?` performs a bounded least-prime search and `orderOf` computes
  multiplicative order with a complete correctness API.

# Verification

Certificate search, random choices, and factor discovery are untrusted
producers. Only the exposed Boolean checker and its Lean proof establish
primality. Successful bounded and total decisions are exact, and every
successful factor search returns a proper divisor.

```lean
theorem prime_of_checkPrimeAt {n : Nat} {c : PrimeCert}
    (h : (c.subject == n && checkPrime c) = true) : Prime n

theorem isPrime_iff {n : Nat} : isPrime n = true ↔ Prime n

theorem rhoFactor?_spec {n d : Nat} {r r' : Rand} {fuel : Nat}
    (h : rhoFactor? n r fuel = .ok (d, r')) : 1 < d ∧ d < n ∧ d ∣ n
```

The `primality` elaborator supports certificate proofs through 512 input bits
under a fixed, bounded search policy. Search exhaustion is reported and never
turned into a mathematical result. See the [SPEC](SPEC/hex-primality.md) for
the exact fuel, failure, and trust contracts.

Development happens in the
[`hex-dev`](https://github.com/kim-em/hex-dev) monorepo, not in this published
mirror. Contributions are welcome as pull requests to the `SPEC/` directory:
describe the behavior you want and leave the implementation to the maintainer.
